# kata-pencil-durability

This repository contains a test-driven JavaScript implementation of the **Pencil Durability Kata**, designed to simulate the behavior of a real-life pencil. The kata is built using **JavaScript (ES6)** and tested with **Jest**.

---

## Kata Objective

Simulate the behavior of a pencil, including:

- Writing text with point degradation
- Sharpening the pencil to restore durability
- Erasing text with limited eraser durability
- Editing erased text with collision handling (`@`)
- Preventing actions once pencil or eraser is "worn out"
